# Synthetic Ping Monitoring Platform 

Repo for developing a Ping monitor 

This project develops a ping monitor by using the Ping Parsing and Prometheus library with python  to collect metrics and Grafana to help visualize them. 

## Synthetic Monitoring 
Synthetic Monitoring is the simulation of real user behaviors and actions on web pages in order to identify potential issues and improve functionality, performance and availability before issues become visible to users. 

## Getting Started 

To get started, you will need to have any IDE installed with Python. I will be using VS Code and Python version 3.10. 

You will also need to install the python ping parser library, Prometheus and Grafana. 

To install the ping parsing library: 
Simply type in this command to your terminal. 

```
pip install pingparsing
```
